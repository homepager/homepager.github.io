HomePager
=========

A productive all-in-one homepage that negates the distracting of the Internet.

Overview
--------

The Internet is an amazing tool to discover almost everything humankind has to offer. Never in history have we have had such a powerful instrument. However, with great power comes great responsibility.

It's only human to be tempted by the entertainment (or lack thereof) that exists on websites we shouldn't be going on. But most of the time, what else are we supposed to do?

I currently use [Leechblock](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/leechblock/), which blocks and redirects any website I consider distracting to. It has some pretty clever features, I'd recommend it.

But it's default `BLOCKED` page is [pretty bland](http://screenshots.en.sftcdn.net/en/scrn/83000/83882/leechblock-4.jpg), and I didn't really know what to do with myself if I wasn't able to mindlessly search through cute cat videos.

So I decided to come up with HomePager. While there's a multitude of lists of handy websites, bookmark services and metaproductive articles, they don't sit right with me. I have specific and personal goals and too many websites I enjoy that it's easy to get off-track.

Portal pages like iGoogle have been on the decline for years, and we need something more intimate and intuitive than just live weather updates and RSS news feeds. So why not create one of your own?

This is a sister project of the [compass repository](http://github.com/brennanbrown/compass). If you like this idea, you'll definitely want to fork that one.
